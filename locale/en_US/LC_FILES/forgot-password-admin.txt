Dear VIKO school administrator,

VIKO user %person_name% (with username %username%)
has lost his/her password.

Because the user has not defined his e-mail address,
it was not possible to automatically create new
password and send it to him with e-mail.

You can use VIKO administration interface to set
new password for this user. You may also set his
e-mail address to make further requests for new
password automatic.


Best wishes,

VIKO
